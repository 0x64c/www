<h2>A pair of addictive physics-based 3D games. </h2>

<p>Tilt the floor to roll a ball through an obstacle course before time runs out. Neverball is part puzzle game, part action game, and entirely a test of skill. It is similar to the Gamecube/iPhone game 'Super Monkey Ball'. It is GPU-accelerated and fully supports the GCW Zero's tilt sensor, along with traditional controls.</p>

<p>Neverball is two games in one: it includes Neverputt, a miniature golf game with many unique levels and support for 1-4 players, built on the physics and graphics engine of Neverball. For the GCW Zero port, new controls and camera options have been added, as well as a new 'Finesse Mode' allowing for finer movement control in the absence of a mouse. In addition to including the many official levelsets, the port also comes with <a href="http://forum.nevercorner.net/viewtopic.php?id=2793">three excellent levelsets</a> from community map-creator Reshaun Francis. The game's community is quite active and unofficial levelsets can easily be installed. Additional levels can be found at the <a href="http://wiki.nevercorner.net/doku.php/level_sets">wiki page</a> from nevercorner.net, a self proclaimed source for community-driven Neverball/Neverputt information. More level contributions can be found in their official forums.</p>

<p>Neverball expands on the ideas of previous games in the genre, allowing many different types of levels to be created. Some levels focus on balance and finesse. Other levels test puzzle solving ability, using timers, transporters, and switches as challenges. Still others require racing at high speeds across racetracks which might include huge ramps or loops. A final class of levels involve solving labyrinths within a set amount of time. The single uniting factor is its excellent adherence to physics, which really helps to immerse the player regardless.</p>

<p>Neverball & Neverputt are packaged together and can be freely downloaded from the <a href="http://repo.gcw-zero.com">GCW software repository</a>.</p>
